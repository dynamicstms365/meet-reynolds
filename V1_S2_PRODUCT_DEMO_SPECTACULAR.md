## **Scene Content**

### **Reality Transformation**
Reynolds snaps his fingers with a dramatic flourish, and the modern co-working space TRANSFORMS into a cheesy infomercial set with dramatic studio lighting, colorful backdrops, and "BEFORE" and "AFTER" podiums. Golden sparkles and reality-bending effects sweep across the scene.

### **Character Setup**
- **Left Podium:** Jenny (junior developer, now looking confused in infomercial lighting)
- **Right Podium:** Mark (senior developer, mid-30s, also confused about the sudden setting change)
- **Center Stage:** Reynolds, now in full game show host mode

### **Dialogue Sequence**
**Reynolds:** [walking between podiums like a game show host]
*"Let me show you the INCREDIBLE difference between these architectural approaches! On my left, we have our junior developer friend—let's call her 'Codesmith Jenny'—and she's about to experience the MIRACLE of elegant simplicity!"*

**Jenny:** "My name isn't Jenny..."

**Reynolds:** [ignoring her completely, gesturing dramatically at a floating holographic display of her screen]
*"LOOK at this beauty! Just FOUR files! Count them with me, folks: adapter.ts, agent.ts, config.ts, index.ts. That's it! No PhD in architecture required!"*

**Reynolds:** [teleports to Mark with sparkle effects]
*"And over here we have 'Enterprise Ed'—"*

**Mark:** "Actually, I'm Mark—"

**Reynolds:** [cutting him off with jazz hands]
*"—Ed here gets the FULL MONTY! Eighty-plus files of pure orchestration power! Look at those folders multiply!"*

[Reynolds snaps fingers again - Mark's screen displays files cascading like a waterfall]

### **Visual Effects**
- **Infomercial-style arrows** pointing at key features with "ONLY 4 FILES!" text
- **"80+ FILES OF POWER!"** floating in 3D space around Mark
- **Cheesy transition wipes** between the two setups
- **Sparkle effects** for Reynolds' teleportation
- **Reality transformation** waves sweeping across the scene

### **Screen Displays**
- **Jenny's Display:** Clean, simple file structure highlighted in green
- **Mark's Display:** Complex folder hierarchy with cascading file animations
- **Floating UI Elements:** Infomercial-style callouts and arrows

### **Reynolds' Final Pitch**
**Reynolds:** [back to camera with theatrical pose]
*"But wait—there's MORE! Both solutions come with built-in AI assistance! No additional fees, no hidden costs!"*
