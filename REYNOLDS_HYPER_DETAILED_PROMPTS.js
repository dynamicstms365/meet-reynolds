    prompt: `EXTREME CLOSE-UP establishing shot: A figure wearing a form-fitting, crimson red tactical mask that completely covers their entire head and face, with two large oval white eye patches positioned exactly where the eyes would be. The mask material is matte leather-textured fabric, seamlessly fitted without any visible seams or openings. The figure wears a black tactical suit with bright red geometric panel inserts running down the arms and across the chest in angular lightning-bolt patterns. 

The masked figure stands precisely 6 feet from camera in a modern co-working space with exposed concrete pillars, floor-to-ceiling windows showing a city skyline, and white standing desks with silver MacBook laptops open. Behind the masked figure, exactly 3 developers sit at workstations - one woman with shoulder-length brown hair in a gray sweater typing on a laptop, one man with dark hair and glasses wearing a blue button-down shirt looking at dual monitors, and one person with blonde hair in a black t-shirt debugging code on screen.

The masked figure raises their right hand directly toward camera, index finger pointing straight at the lens, while their left hand rests confidently on their hip. Their head tilts exactly 15 degrees to the right with the white eye patches appearing to look directly through the camera at the viewer. The figure's posture exudes supernatural confidence - shoulders back, chest forward, feet positioned shoulder-width apart in a power stance.

LIGHTING: Professional three-point lighting with a key light 45 degrees camera-left creating dramatic shadows on the right side of the mask, fill light softening shadows, and rim light outlining the figure's silhouette. The white eye patches catch and reflect the light, creating an otherworldly glow.

CAMERA: Static shot, eye-level, 85mm lens with shallow depth of field - the masked figure razor-sharp in focus while the background developers are artistically blurred. No camera movement.

The masked figure's body language communicates: "I know you're watching, and I'm about to show you something incredible." This is a supernatural being who exists between dimensions, comfortable breaking the fourth wall and addressing audiences directly.`

    prompt: `WIDE SHOT TRANSFORMATION SEQUENCE: The scene begins in the same modern co-working space from Scene 1, then REALITY WARPS with golden sparkle particle effects sweeping across the frame left-to-right. As the sparkles clear, the environment has transformed into a cheesy 1990s infomercial set.

THE TRANSFORMED SET: Curved powder-blue backdrop with metallic gold trim, two burgundy leather podiums positioned 8 feet apart, professional studio lighting with warm amber key lights and cool blue accent lights. Large "BEFORE" and "AFTER" signs in chrome letters mounted above each podium.

LEFT PODIUM - JENNY: A woman in her late 20s with shoulder-length auburn hair, wearing a casual gray cardigan over a white t-shirt and dark jeans. She stands behind the left podium looking confused but curious, hands resting on the podium surface, eyes darting around trying to understand the sudden setting change. A holographic display floats 3 feet above her head showing a clean file structure with exactly 4 files labeled "adapter.ts", "agent.ts", "config.ts", "index.ts" in green text.

RIGHT PODIUM - MARK: A man in his mid-30s with dark brown hair, trimmed beard, wearing a navy blue button-down shirt and khaki pants. He stands behind the right podium with arms crossed, raising one eyebrow in bewilderment. Above his head, a holographic display shows a complex folder hierarchy with 80+ files cascading like a waterfall in blue text.

CENTER STAGE - REYNOLDS: The same masked figure from Scene 1, now positioned exactly center-frame between the podiums. The red and black tactical suit gleams under studio lights. Reynolds' white eye patches are directed toward camera while both hands gesture dramatically outward toward the podiums in an exaggerated game-show-host manner. The figure's posture is theatrical - one foot slightly forward, back straight, arms extended with palms open presenting the "products."

VISUAL EFFECTS: Infomercial-style golden arrows appear pointing at key features, rotating 3D text reading "ONLY 4 FILES!" and "80+ FILES OF POWER!" Large explosion graphics with "POW!" and "BAM!" text overlays typical of vintage advertisements.

CAMERA: Smooth tracking shot moving in a semi-circle around Reynolds while keeping the podiums in frame, mimicking classic infomercial cinematography with slightly over-saturated colors and high contrast lighting.`

    prompt: `TALK SHOW SET INTERIOR: A professional television studio with a curved desk setup. The main area features two burgundy leather interview chairs positioned at a 45-degree angle facing each other, separated by a small glass coffee table with a potted plant. Behind them, a large curved LED screen displays rotating "TESTIMONIALS" graphics in gold and blue.

JENNY: The same auburn-haired woman from Scene 2, now seated in the left chair wearing a light blue blouse and dark slacks. She sits with slightly uncertain posture - back straight but hands fidgeting slightly, eyes occasionally looking around as if still processing the surreal situation. Her facial expression shows confusion mixed with reluctant cooperation.

MARK: The same dark-haired, bearded man from Scene 2, seated in the right chair wearing the same navy shirt. He leans back with arms crossed, one eyebrow raised in resigned skepticism. His body language says "I'm going along with this madness but I'm not happy about it."

REYNOLDS: The masked figure stands exactly center-frame between the chairs, holding a professional silver microphone in their right hand positioned 6 inches from the red mask. The figure's left hand rests confidently on their hip while the white eye patches alternate looking toward each guest, then directly at camera. The red and black tactical suit reflects the studio lights dramatically.

BACKGROUND DISPLAYS: Multiple monitors show split-screen views of both architectural solutions running simultaneously - clean simple interface on left screens, complex orchestration dashboards on right screens. Fake audience applause track plays (no visible audience).

LIGHTING: Classic three-point television interview lighting - warm key light on faces, cool blue accent lighting on background, dramatic rim lighting on Reynolds' mask creating an otherworldly glow around the white eye patches.

CAMERA: Professional multi-camera setup with smooth cuts between wide shots showing all three figures and medium shots focusing on Reynolds' dramatic microphone gestures. The masked figure dominates every frame through confident positioning and theatrical body language.

AUDIO VISUAL: Text overlays appear as speech bubbles with personality-matched fonts - Jenny's text in friendly rounded font, Mark's in technical serif font, Reynolds' in bold dramatic lettering.`

    prompt: `HOLOGRAPHIC DATA VISUALIZATION SPECTACULAR: The talk show set from Scene 3 now features a massive floating holographic comparison chart suspended 4 feet above the coffee table between Jenny and Mark's chairs. The chart is a translucent blue 3D structure, 6 feet wide by 4 feet tall, rotating slowly with particle effects around its edges.

THE HOLOGRAPHIC CHART displays in glowing white text:
- Left column: "Reynolds Teams Agent" with green checkmarks and lightning bolt icons
- Right column: "CopilotAgent" with blue stars and galaxy icons  
- Rows showing: "Setup Time: ‚ö°2 Hours vs üèóÔ∏è2 Months", "Complexity: üéØLaser Focused vs üåüEnterprise Galaxy", "AI Integration: ‚úÖBuilt-in vs ‚úÖNext-Level"

REYNOLDS: The masked figure now holds a futuristic laser pointer device - a sleek silver cylinder with red accent lines that emit actual visible red, blue, and green laser beams. Reynolds stands in an action pose with feet planted shoulder-width apart, right arm extended holding the laser pointer toward the chart, left arm positioned dramatically behind for balance. The white eye patches are focused intently on the chart while the laser creates spectacular light effects bouncing off the holographic surface.

JENNY AND MARK: Both remain seated but now lean forward with genuine interest, Jenny pointing at the chart while Mark nods approvingly. Their previous confusion has transformed into impressed fascination with the visual spectacle.

LASER EFFECTS: The laser pointer creates continuous colorful beams - red highlighting "2 Hours", blue emphasizing "Enterprise Galaxy", green outlining the checkmarks. Where each laser hits the holographic chart, bright spark effects appear with trailing particle animations.

EXPLOSION SEQUENCE: As the scene climaxes, the entire chart explodes in a shower of gold and silver confetti, with rainbow particle effects radiating outward. A massive "CHOOSE YOUR ADVENTURE!" banner unfolds from the ceiling in shimmering holographic text.

CAMERA: Dynamic cinematography starting with a medium wide shot, then pushing in on Reynolds during the laser demonstration, followed by sweeping around the exploding chart in a 360-degree rotation as confetti fills the frame.

LIGHTING: Dramatic spotlighting on Reynolds with the laser effects creating moving colored patterns across the mask and suit, while the holographic chart casts blue ambient light throughout the scene.`

    prompt: `INSPIRATIONAL GROUP FINALE: The confetti from Scene 4 settles as warm, golden hour lighting transforms the studio into an inspirational setting. The background now displays both architectural solutions running harmoniously on floating translucent screens positioned symmetrically behind the group.

GROUP FORMATION: Reynolds stands precisely center-frame, with Jenny positioned 2 feet to Reynolds' left and Mark 2 feet to Reynolds' right. Reynolds' left arm drapes casually but confidently around Jenny's shoulders, while the right arm rests around Mark's shoulders, creating a unified trio. All three face directly toward camera.

REYNOLDS: The masked figure's posture radiates supernatural confidence and wisdom. The white eye patches appear to look directly through the camera at the viewer with knowing intelligence. The red and black tactical suit gleams under the warm lighting, and for this brief moment, the figure's body language suggests genuine sincerity beneath the theatrical persona.

JENNY: Now completely at ease, she stands with relaxed shoulders and a genuine smile, her earlier confusion replaced with understanding and enthusiasm. She looks toward camera with newfound confidence, one hand resting naturally at her side while the other accepts Reynolds' arm around her shoulder.

MARK: His previous skepticism has transformed into appreciative respect. He stands with good posture, arms relaxed, a slight smile showing he's genuinely impressed with the orchestrated presentation. His professional demeanor now includes warmth and collaboration.

BACKGROUND DISPLAYS: Floating screens show both solutions in perfect harmony - the simple 4-file structure on the left runs smoothly while the complex 80+ file orchestration system operates seamlessly on the right. Success metrics, happy user icons, and positive graphs float gently around the group like digital fairy dust.

"MAXIMUM EFFORT‚Ñ¢" LOGO: A golden holographic logo materializes above the group with supernatural sparkle effects, the text glowing with warm light that reflects off Reynolds' mask.

LIGHTING: Cinematic golden hour lighting with warm amber key lights creating a halo effect around all three figures. Subtle rim lighting outlines their silhouettes while soft fill lighting ensures all details remain visible. The white eye patches on Reynolds' mask catch and reflect this warm light, creating an otherworldly but benevolent glow.

CAMERA: Static medium wide shot that captures all three figures from waist up, with perfect symmetrical composition emphasizing unity and collaboration.

EMOTIONAL TONE: The scene radiates wisdom, accomplishment, and genuine guidance - Reynolds as the supernatural mentor who has successfully brought two different approaches together in harmony.`
