# GitHub Issue: Teams Bot User Introduction and Cross-Platform Mapping

## Title
Implement "Introduce yourself to [name]" functionality with Teams-GitHub user mapping

## Description
Add sophisticated user identification and cross-platform mapping capabilities to the Reynolds Teams bot to handle introduction requests with Maximum Effort™.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Handle "Introduce yourself to [name]" commands in Teams chat
- [ ] Implement intelligent user lookup with caching layer
- [ ] Microsoft Graph API integration for user discovery
- [ ] GitHub organization member mapping
- [ ] Persistent user mapping storage (Teams ↔ GitHub)
- [ ] Bot-initiated conversation capabilities

### User Lookup Flow
1. **Cache Check**: Look for existing Teams → GitHub mapping
2. **Graph API Lookup**: Search Microsoft Graph for user by name/email
3. **GitHub Mapping**: Attempt to correlate with GitHub organization members
4. **Interactive Resolution**: When mapping is ambiguous, present options to user
5. **Mapping Persistence**: Store successful correlations for future use

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- [ ] Handle ambiguous name matches gracefully
- [ ] Provide interactive GitHub username selection when mapping fails
- [ ] Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and telemetry

### Testing Configuration
- **Test User**: christaylor@nextgeneration.com
- **Test GitHub ID**: cege7480
- **Organization**: NextGenerationLogistics

## Technical Implementation

### New Services Required
1. **UserMappingService**: Cache and persistence layer
2. **GraphUserLookupService**: Microsoft Graph integration
3. **GitHubOrgMemberService**: GitHub organization member discovery
4. **IntroductionOrchestrator**: Coordinate the entire flow

### Bot Integration
- Extend [`OnMessageActivityAsync`](src/CopilotAgent/Bot/ReynoldsTeamsBot.cs:38-56) with introduction pattern recognition
- Leverage existing [`ReynoldsTeamsChatService`](src/CopilotAgent/Services/ReynoldsTeamsChatService.cs:79-114) for bot-initiated chats
- Integrate with [`EnterpriseAuthService`](src/CopilotAgent/Services/EnterpriseAuthService.cs:24-29) for secure operations

### Caching Strategy
- In-memory cache with configurable TTL
- Persistent storage for confirmed mappings
- Cache invalidation policies

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Bot successfully handles introduction requests
- [ ] User lookup works across Microsoft Graph and GitHub
- [ ] Mapping persistence prevents repeated lookups
- [ ] Interactive fallback works when mapping is unclear
- [ ] Bot can initiate conversations with discovered users
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage including the provided test case

## Reynolds Enhancement
All functionality will be delivered with Reynolds' signature charm and diplomatic excellence, ensuring maximum coordination efficiency across platforms.
