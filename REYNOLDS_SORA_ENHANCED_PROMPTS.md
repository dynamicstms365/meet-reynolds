## ðŸŽ¬ **UPDATED MASTER SORA PROMPT with Visual Reference**

### **Primary Production Prompt (Enhanced)**
```
SCENE: Futuristic enterprise command center with holographic repository displays

CHARACTER: Reynolds wearing iconic red and black tactical coordination suit (reference: provided Deadpool image aesthetic). Professional adaptation with tech-enhanced details - red fabric with black panel lines, utility belt with coordination devices, sleek tactical design adapted for enterprise leadership. Confident, casual authority pose similar to reference image.

VISUAL REFERENCE INTEGRATION: Maintain the characteristic red/black color scheme, tactical suit design, and confident body language from the provided image. Adapt weapons/combat elements to coordination tools - holographic interfaces, data management devices, enterprise technology integration.

ENVIRONMENT: Circular command center with 20 floating repository nodes (meet-reynolds, DTMS.Aspire, NGL assemblies, etc.). Each repository sphere color-coded: C# (blue), VB.NET (amber), TypeScript (yellow), Python (green), Shell (silver).

ACTION SEQUENCE:
0-8s: Reynolds in characteristic relaxed pose (reference image style) as repositories orbit around him
8-15s: Straightens into coordination stance, gestures trigger repository responses
15-25s: Orchestrates parallel transformation - VB.NET gears becoming C# streams
25-30s: Epic reveal of fully coordinated enterprise ecosystem

TECHNICAL ADAPTATION: Professional lighting on red suit creating cinematic hero effect, holographic displays reflecting off tactical suit panels, enterprise branding integrated into suit design without losing iconic aesthetic.

CAMERA: Dynamic shots emphasizing both technical mastery and characteristic Reynolds charm, hero angles showing suit details and confident coordination poses.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **3D MODEL INTEGRATION STRATEGY**

### **TurboSquid Asset Specifications**
- **Polygons**: 21,732 (professional quality for close-ups)
- **Vertices**: 23,100 (smooth deformation)
- **Rigged**: Full character animation capability
- **UV Mapped**: Ready for texture customization
- **Formats**: Maya 2016.5 (native), FBX, OBJ

### **Integration Approaches**

#### **Option 1: Sora Reference Integration**
```
Prompt Enhancement with 3D Reference:
"Character design based on professional 3D model - red tactical suit with black details, specific polygon mesh accuracy, rigged for natural movement. Reference high-quality 3D character model with 21,000+ polygon detail level for facial expressions and suit texture fidelity."

Benefits: Sora understands the quality level and detail expectations
Workflow: Provide 3D model screenshots as visual reference in prompt
```

#### **Option 2: Hybrid Production Pipeline**
```
Phase 1: Generate base Sora video with enhanced character description
Phase 2: Use 3D model for detailed close-up shots and specific gestures
Phase 3: Composite 3D elements with Sora-generated environments

Technical Requirements:
- Maya 2016.5 for character animation
- Mental Ray rendering for cinematic quality
- FBX export for post-production integration
- Match lighting between Sora and 3D rendered elements
```

#### **Option 3: 3D-Informed Sora Generation**
```
Pre-Production: Render key poses/expressions from 3D model
Reference Integration: Use rendered frames as visual reference for Sora
Enhanced Prompting: "Character appearance matching provided 3D reference renders - specific suit details, fabric texture, panel lines, professional rigging quality"

Advantages: Best of both worlds - 3D precision with Sora environmental generation
```

## ðŸŽ­ **ENHANCED SCENE PROMPTS**

### **Scene 1: The Coordinator's Domain (0-8s)**
```
Reynolds leans casually against the central command console in characteristic pose (reference provided image). Red tactical suit with black details catches dramatic lighting from 20 floating repository spheres. Maintains confident, slightly amused expression while surveying the enterprise landscape. Camera slowly circles, showing suit details and professional adaptation of iconic design.

3D INTEGRATION: Use rigged model for precise pose matching, facial expressions, and suit detail accuracy.
```

### **Scene 2: Orchestration Activation (8-15s)**
```
Reynolds straightens from casual pose into active coordination stance. Red-gloved hands gesture toward meet-reynolds repository hub - it pulses bright blue in response. Legacy VB.NET assemblies (amber gears) begin transformation sequence. Tactical suit's tech enhancements activate with subtle illumination.

3D INTEGRATION: Utilize rig for smooth transition between poses, hand gesture precision, and suit technology activation effects.
```

### **Scene 3: Parallel Coordination Mastery (15-25s)**
```
Multiple repository transformations occur simultaneously. Reynolds orchestrates with both hands - left directing legacy modernization, right coordinating modern platform deployment. Red suit moves fluidly as he conducts the enterprise transformation symphony. Data streams flow around him like choreographed light shows.

3D INTEGRATION: Complex multi-hand coordination requiring rigged model precision for natural movement and gesture timing.
```

### **Scene 4: Enterprise Revelation (25-30s)**
```
Camera pulls back dramatically revealing Reynolds standing triumphant in center of perfectly orchestrated 20-repository constellation. Red tactical suit creates striking silhouette against holographic enterprise data. Slight characteristic smirk showing satisfaction with coordination mastery.

3D INTEGRATION: Hero pose requiring 3D model for perfect silhouette and facial expression detail.
```
