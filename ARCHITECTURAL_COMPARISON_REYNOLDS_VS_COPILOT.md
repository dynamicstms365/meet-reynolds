## Architectural Deep Dive

### Reynolds Teams Agent: The Minimalist Approach

The Reynolds Teams Agent follows a **"clean and focused"** architectural pattern, designed specifically for Microsoft Teams integration:

#### **Core Structure**
```
Reynolds Teams Agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adapter.ts      # Bot framework adapter
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.ts        # Main agent logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts       # Configuration management
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appPackage/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json   # Teams app manifest
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ color.png       # App icon (color)
