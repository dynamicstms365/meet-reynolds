## 🎯 Objective
System learns and updates knowledge automatically from usage patterns and interactions to create a self-improving knowledge base.

## 📋 Description
Implement automatic knowledge base enrichment that learns from user interactions, tracks usage patterns, and continuously improves the knowledge repository. This creates the learning branch of our AI enhancement binary tree.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Implement usage pattern tracking and analysis
- [ ] Create automatic documentation updates based on user interactions
- [ ] Add FAQ generation from common queries and issues
- [ ] Implement knowledge gap detection and alerting
- [ ] Create feedback loop for knowledge quality improvement
- [ ] Add knowledge source validation and verification
- [ ] Implement knowledge deduplication and consolidation
- [ ] Create knowledge freshness monitoring and updates

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Usage patterns are tracked and analyzed for knowledge insights
- [ ] Documentation is automatically updated based on user feedback
- [ ] FAQ section is generated and maintained from common queries
- [ ] Knowledge gaps are detected and flagged for attention
- [ ] Knowledge quality improves measurably over time
- [ ] Duplicate or conflicting knowledge is identified and resolved
- [ ] Knowledge freshness is monitored and outdated content updated
- [ ] User satisfaction with knowledge quality >95%

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: Automated Testing Framework (Issue #06)
- Blocks: Basic Teams Integration (Issue #08)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Knowledge quality score improvement: >20% per month
- Knowledge gap detection accuracy: >90%
- User satisfaction with knowledge: >95%
- Knowledge freshness: >90% of content updated within 30 days

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Integrate with existing knowledge base from Issue #04
- Use machine learning for pattern recognition
- Implement feedback collection mechanisms
