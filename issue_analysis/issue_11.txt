## 🎯 Objective
Create initial knowledge base from existing documentation to enable intelligent query responses and context-aware assistance.

## 📋 Description
Bootstrap the AI knowledge system by indexing existing documentation and creating semantic search capabilities. This forms the foundation of the intelligent assistance layer in our binary tree architecture.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Index existing markdown files in [`docs/`](docs/) directory structure
- [ ] Enhance [`KnowledgeRetriever`](src/CopilotAgent/Skills/AgentSkills.cs:1) with advanced capabilities
- [ ] Implement semantic search using vector embeddings
- [ ] Create knowledge categorization and tagging system
- [ ] Test knowledge retrieval accuracy with sample queries
- [ ] Add knowledge base versioning and update mechanisms
- [ ] Implement knowledge quality scoring and validation
- [ ] Create knowledge gap detection and reporting

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All documentation in [`docs/`](docs/) is successfully indexed and searchable
- [ ] Semantic search returns relevant results for >95% of queries
- [ ] Knowledge retrieval response time is <2 seconds
- [ ] Knowledge base includes proper categorization and metadata
- [ ] Quality scoring identifies and flags outdated or incomplete content
- [ ] System can detect and report knowledge gaps
- [ ] Versioning system tracks changes and updates to knowledge content
- [ ] Initial knowledge base covers all CLI tools and agent capabilities

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: CLI Integration Foundation (Issue #03)
- Blocks: Self-Documenting Code Generation (Issue #05)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Query response accuracy: >95%
- Response time: <2 seconds average
- Knowledge coverage: 100% of existing documentation
- Knowledge freshness: Updated within 24 hours of source changes

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Build upon [`AgentSkills.cs`](src/CopilotAgent/Skills/AgentSkills.cs:1)
- Index documentation from [`docs/cli-tools/`](docs/cli-tools/), [`docs/github-copilot/`](docs/github-copilot/)
- Integrate with existing [`Models.cs`](src/Shared/Models/Models.cs:1) for data structures
