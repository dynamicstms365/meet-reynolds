## 🎯 Objective
AI maintains its own documentation through context-aware help systems and user interaction learning.

## 📋 Description
Implement intelligent documentation agent that automatically generates, maintains, and improves documentation based on code changes, user interactions, and usage patterns. This creates the documentation branch of Phase 2's self-acceleration binary tree.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Implement automatic documentation generation from code analysis
- [ ] Create context-aware help system that adapts to user needs
- [ ] Add user interaction learning for documentation improvement
- [ ] Implement knowledge base optimization algorithms
- [ ] Create documentation quality scoring and enhancement
- [ ] Add documentation versioning and change tracking
- [ ] Implement documentation consistency checking
- [ ] Create documentation usage analytics and optimization

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documentation is automatically generated for all code changes
- [ ] Help system provides contextually relevant assistance >90% of the time
- [ ] User interaction learning improves documentation relevance by >40%
- [ ] Knowledge base optimization reduces search time by >50%
- [ ] Documentation quality scores improve continuously
- [ ] Version tracking maintains complete documentation history
- [ ] Consistency checking identifies and resolves conflicts automatically
- [ ] Usage analytics drive documentation prioritization effectively

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: Testing Agent (Issue #10)
- Blocks: Performance Analytics (Issue #12)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Documentation coverage: >98% of functionality
- Help system relevance: >90%
- User satisfaction with documentation: >95%
- Documentation maintenance automation: >85%

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Build upon existing documentation in [`docs/`](docs/) directory
- Integrate with knowledge base from Issues #04 and #07
- Use natural language processing for content generation
