## Overview
This issue summarizes the complete debugging journey for resolving GitHub App authentication issues in Azure Container Apps deployment workflow.

## Initial Problem
- JWT authentication error: "A JSON web token could not be decoded (HTTP 401)"
- GitHub workflow failing during webhook URL update operation
- Deployment pipeline unable to complete successfully

## Debugging Journey

### Phase 1: Token Type Identification
- **Issue**: `actions/create-github-app-token@v2` generating `ghs_...` (installation) instead of `eyJ...` (JWT) tokens
- **Solution**: Switched to `tibdex/github-app-token@v2` with `installation_retrieval_mode: none`
- **Result**: "Unsupported retrieval mode: none" error

### Phase 2: Action Availability Problems  
- **Issue**: `github-jwt/github-jwt@v1.2` action not found
- **Issue**: `gha-utils/jwt-generator@v1` action not found
- **Learning**: GitHub Actions marketplace has limited JWT generation options

### Phase 3: Custom Implementation
- **Solution**: Node.js script with `jsonwebtoken` library
- **Approach**: Generate JWT tokens using RS256 algorithm with proper payload
- **Result**: Successful JWT generation and workflow progression

## Final Resolution

up to date, audited 31 packages in 501ms

2 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities

## Key Learnings Applied
1. **Authentication Types**: Understanding JWT vs installation token use cases
2. **External Dependencies**: Avoiding unreliable GitHub Actions marketplace dependencies  
3. **Custom Solutions**: Using standard tools (Node.js + npm) for reliability
4. **Systematic Approach**: One issue at a time, validate with logs, document findings
5. **Token Management**: Proper token generation for MCP server integration

## Workflow Status
✅ Build job completing successfully  
✅ Deploy job reaching JWT generation  
✅ Azure Container Apps deployment working  
✅ Health checks passing  
✅ MCP capabilities endpoint responding  
⚠️ Webhook URL update (resolved manually)

- MCP server ready for connection with provided tokens
- All learnings documented for future reference
