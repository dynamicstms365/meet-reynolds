**SUCCESS UPDATE**

‚úÖ **Webhook endpoint is now WORKING correctlyfalse*

**Container Logs Analysis**:
- Application successfully deployed and running
- Webhooks reaching correct endpoint: /api/github/webhook
- Webhook processing pipeline functional

**Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Deployment: SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ Endpoint routing: SUCCESS  
- ‚úÖ Webhook reception: SUCCESS
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration: Needs attention

**Remaining Configuration Issues**:

1. **Webhook Secret Missing**:
   
   - Need to set NGL_DEVOPS_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable
   - Critical for security - currently skipping signature validation

2. **Installation ID Context**:
   
   - Some GitHub event types don't include installation context
   - May need logic refinement for specific event types

**Webhook Processing Evidence**:


**Next Steps**:
1. Configure webhook secret in Azure Container App environment
2. Review webhook validation logic for event types without installation context
3. Test with properly configured webhook secret

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Core functionality working, security configuration needed

**Status**: Deployment pipeline SUCCESSFUL - webhook processing operational
