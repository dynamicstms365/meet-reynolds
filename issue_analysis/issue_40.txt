## Overview
Implement conversation context tracking to maintain discussion flow and user interaction history.

## Tasks
- [ ] Choose conversation state management approach (repository-based recommended for MVP)
- [ ] Create conversation context storage in `.github/conversations/` directory
- [ ] Implement conversation session tracking by user and timestamp
- [ ] Add conversation history retrieval for context-aware responses
- [ ] Create conversation cleanup and archival processes
- [ ] Add conversation analytics and insights

## Implementation Options
### Option 1: Repository-Based (Recommended for MVP)
- Store in `.github/conversations/{user}-{timestamp}.json`
- Auto-index with existing knowledge base system
- Version controlled and simple to implement

### Option 2: GitHub Native Integration
- Use discussion comments for conversation threads
- Natural GitHub workflow integration

### Option 3: Redis DataStore (Future Enhancement)
- Real-time tracking across interactions
- Requires additional infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Conversation context persists across multiple interactions
- [ ] User conversation history is retrievable and searchable
- [ ] Context-aware responses reference previous interactions
- [ ] Conversation data is properly formatted and indexed
- [ ] System handles concurrent conversations gracefully

## Related Files
- `.github/conversations/` (create directory structure)
- `src/CopilotAgent/Services/ConversationService.cs` (create)
- `scripts/dev/results/mcp-integration-plan.md`

## Definition of Done
- Conversation state persists and can be retrieved
- Multiple concurrent conversations are supported
- Context-aware responses work as demonstrated in test scenarios
