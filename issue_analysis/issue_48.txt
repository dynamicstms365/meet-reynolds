## Problem
During deployment workflow debugging, we discovered that `tibdex/github-app-token@v2` generates GitHub App **installation tokens** (`ghs_...`) instead of **JWT tokens** (`eyJ...`) required for app-level operations.

## Root Cause
- Installation tokens are for repository-specific operations
- JWT tokens are required for app-level operations like updating webhook URLs
- The `installation_retrieval_mode: none` parameter is unsupported by `tibdex/github-app-token@v2`

## Solution Implemented

added 15 packages, and audited 31 packages in 715ms

2 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities

## Key Learnings
1. **Token Types**: Understand the difference between JWT and installation tokens
2. **Authentication Flow**: App-level operations require JWT tokens
3. **Action Limitations**: Not all GitHub Actions support all authentication modes
4. **Manual Generation**: Node.js + jsonwebtoken is more reliable than external actions
