## Problem
Complex GitHub workflow failures require systematic debugging approach to identify root causes efficiently.

## Debugging Methodology Applied

### 1. Error Analysis
- Read complete workflow logs
- Identify exact failure points
- Categorize error types (authentication, configuration, dependency)

### 2. Root Cause Investigation
- Analyze 5-7 possible sources
- Distill to 1-2 most likely causes
- Validate assumptions with logs/evidence

### 3. Solution Implementation
- Test one fix at a time
- Commit and push changes systematically
- Monitor workflow runs for success/failure

### 4. Documentation
- Record learnings as issues
- Document solution approaches
- Share knowledge for future debugging

## Key Techniques Used
1. **Log Analysis**: `gh run view [ID] --log` for detailed inspection
2. **Incremental Testing**: Fix one issue, test, then move to next
3. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Use actual error messages, not assumptions
4. **Alternative Approaches**: When external dependencies fail, use standard tools

## Tools and Commands
```bash
# Monitor workflow progress
gh run watch [ID]

# Get detailed logs
gh run view [ID] --log

# List recent runs
gh run list --limit 5
```

## Success Metrics
- Moved from initial JWT authentication failure
- Through multiple token generation attempts  
- To successful workflow completion with proper authentication
- Documented all learnings for future reference

## Best Practices
- Always wait for tool use confirmation before proceeding
- Use step-by-step approach rather than multiple simultaneous changes
- Validate each fix before moving to next issue
- Document both failures and solutions
