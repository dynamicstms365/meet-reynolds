## 🎯 Objective
Autonomous code development and management that handles issue-to-code automation and PR lifecycle management.

## 📋 Description
Implement specialized GitHub Coding Agent that forms the left branch of Phase 3's orchestration tree. This agent handles all GitHub-specific operations including issue processing, code generation, PR management, and deployment automation.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Implement issue-to-code automation pipeline
- [ ] Create intelligent PR review and approval logic
- [ ] Add automated code quality enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] Build deployment automation with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Implement code conflict resolution and merge strategies
- [ ] Create repository management and maintenance automation
- [ ] Add branch strategy optimization and management
- [ ] Implement code metrics tracking and reporting

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Issue-to-code automation generates working code from GitHub issues >80% of the time
- [ ] PR review logic identifies and flags issues with >90% accuracy
- [ ] Code quality enforcement prevents substandard code from merging
- [ ] Deployment automation succeeds >98% of the time with safe rollback
- [ ] Conflict resolution automatically handles >70% of merge conflicts
- [ ] Repository maintenance keeps repos organized and optimized
- [ ] Branch strategy optimization improves development workflow efficiency
- [ ] Code metrics provide actionable insights for continuous improvement

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: Bridge Agent Intelligence (Issue #13)
- Blocks: Teams Declarative Agent (Issue #15)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Issue-to-code success rate: >80%
- PR review accuracy: >90%
- Deployment success rate: >98%
- Conflict resolution automation: >70%

## 🔧 Technical Notes
