## 🎯 Objective
AI creates code that improves AI code generation through recursive self-improvement and pattern recognition.

## 📋 Description
Implement advanced AI-powered code generation that can analyze, improve, and optimize its own code generation capabilities. This forms the left branch of Phase 2's self-acceleration binary tree, focusing on recursive code improvement.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Implement recursive code improvement algorithms
- [ ] Add pattern recognition for code optimization opportunities
- [ ] Create automated refactoring capabilities
- [ ] Build performance-driven code generation
- [ ] Implement code quality scoring and improvement
- [ ] Add code generation learning from successful patterns
- [ ] Create code generation performance metrics and tracking
- [ ] Implement code generation A/B testing framework

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Code generation can analyze and improve its own output
- [ ] Pattern recognition identifies optimization opportunities with >85% accuracy
- [ ] Automated refactoring improves code quality scores by >30%
- [ ] Performance-driven generation reduces execution time by >25%
- [ ] Code quality scores improve continuously over time
- [ ] Learning algorithms incorporate successful patterns automatically
- [ ] Performance metrics show measurable improvement trends
- [ ] A/B testing validates generation improvements

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: Basic Teams Integration (Issue #08) - Phase 1 completion
- Blocks: Testing Agent (Issue #10)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Code generation speed improvement: >50% per iteration
- Code quality score improvement: >30% over baseline
- Pattern recognition accuracy: >85%
- Self-improvement cycle completion time: <24 hours

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Build upon existing [`CodeGenerator`](src/CopilotAgent/Skills/AgentSkills.cs:1)
- Implement machine learning models for pattern recognition
- Use recursive algorithms for self-improvement
