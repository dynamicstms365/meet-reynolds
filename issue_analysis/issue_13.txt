## 🎯 Objective
AI creates and maintains its own tests to ensure code quality and enable confident continuous deployment.

## 📋 Description
Implement AI-powered test generation and maintenance that automatically creates comprehensive test suites for new code and maintains existing tests. This forms the quality assurance branch of our binary tree architecture.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Expand [`CopilotAgent.Tests`](src/CopilotAgent.Tests/) project with AI-generated tests
- [ ] Implement test generation for new code using AI analysis
- [ ] Create integration test automation for CLI services
- [ ] Add performance testing capabilities for agent operations
- [ ] Implement test coverage analysis and reporting
- [ ] Create test maintenance and update automation
- [ ] Add test result analysis and failure prediction
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated execution

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage is >90% for all new code
- [ ] AI generates appropriate unit tests for new methods and classes
- [ ] Integration tests validate CLI service operations
- [ ] Performance tests ensure response times meet targets
- [ ] Test maintenance keeps tests synchronized with code changes
- [ ] Test failure analysis provides actionable insights
- [ ] CI/CD integration runs tests automatically on code changes
- [ ] Test execution time is <5 minutes for full suite

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: Self-Documenting Code Generation (Issue #05)
- Blocks: Knowledge Base Auto-Population (Issue #07)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Test coverage: >90%
- Test execution time: <5 minutes
- Test failure rate: <5%
- Test maintenance automation: >80% of updates automated

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Build upon [`CopilotAgent.Tests`](src/CopilotAgent.Tests/) project
- Enhance [`ServiceTests.cs`](src/CopilotAgent.Tests/Unit/ServiceTests.cs:1)
- Integrate with existing test infrastructure
