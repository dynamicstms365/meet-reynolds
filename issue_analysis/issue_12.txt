## 🎯 Objective
AI generates documentation for its own code to create a self-improving documentation system that reduces manual effort.

## 📋 Description
Implement AI-powered documentation generation that automatically creates and maintains code documentation, README files, and API documentation. This creates the first level of self-improvement in our binary tree architecture.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Enhance [`CodeGenerator`](src/CopilotAgent/Skills/AgentSkills.cs:1) with documentation generation capabilities
- [ ] Implement automatic README updates based on code changes
- [ ] Create intelligent code comment generation system
- [ ] Add API documentation generation from code structure
- [ ] Implement documentation quality scoring and improvement
- [ ] Create documentation templates and standards
- [ ] Add documentation versioning and change tracking
- [ ] Integrate with knowledge base for consistency

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Code documentation is automatically generated for all new methods and classes
- [ ] README files are updated automatically when significant changes occur
- [ ] API documentation is generated and remains synchronized with code
- [ ] Documentation quality score is >90% for generated content
- [ ] Generated documentation follows established templates and standards
- [ ] Documentation changes are tracked and versioned
- [ ] Integration with knowledge base maintains consistency
- [ ] Manual documentation effort reduced by >80%

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: Knowledge Base Bootstrap (Issue #04)
- Blocks: Automated Testing Framework (Issue #06)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Documentation coverage: >95% of code base
- Documentation quality score: >90%
- Manual documentation effort reduction: >80%
- Documentation freshness: Updated within 1 hour of code changes

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Build upon [`AgentSkills.cs`](src/CopilotAgent/Skills/AgentSkills.cs:1)
- Integrate with existing documentation in [`docs/`](docs/)
- Use AI models for natural language generation
