## Overview
Test the complete discussion monitoring system with real conversational scenarios and validate the expected behaviors.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create integration tests for all 3 conversation scenarios
- [ ] Test MCP tools with deployed Azure Container Apps agent
- [ ] Validate natural language confirmation flows
- [ ] Test conversation context retention across interactions
- [ ] Verify discussion search accuracy and relevance
- [ ] Test discussion creation workflow end-to-end

## Test Scenarios
### Scenario 1: No Discussion Exists
- User asks about Power Platform canvas app performance
- Agent should suggest creating new discussion with compelling title
- Test discussion creation through MCP tools

### Scenario 2: Discussion Exists  
- User asks about MCP server implementation
- Agent should ask: "Just checking, are you discussing 'Best practices for MCP server development' (#42) by chance?"
- Test conversation context awareness

### Scenario 3: Multiple Discussions Match
- User has Azure deployment issues
- Agent should present 2-3 relevant options and help choose
- Test disambiguation and user guidance

## Testing Methods
- [ ] Use curl commands from `scripts/dev/results/mcp-integration-plan.md`
- [ ] Run conversation test framework: `./scripts/dev/discussion-monitor-test.sh`
- [ ] Manual testing with real users and conversations
- [ ] Automated integration tests in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance testing under load

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 3 test scenarios work as expected with deployed agent
- [ ] Natural language responses are contextually appropriate
- [ ] Conversation flows feel intuitive and helpful
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds (< 2s response time)
- [ ] Edge cases are handled gracefully

## Definition of Done
- All conversation scenarios validated with real MCP server responses
- User acceptance testing confirms natural conversational flow
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements
