## Problem
During JWT token generation troubleshooting, we discovered that multiple suggested GitHub Actions from the marketplace don't actually exist:

- `github-jwt/github-jwt@v1.2` → **Action not found**
- `gha-utils/jwt-generator@v1` → **Action not found**

## Impact
- Workflow failures at job setup stage
- Time wasted debugging non-existent dependencies
- Need for alternative implementation approaches

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Limited JWT Action Availability**: Very few public actions exist for JWT generation
2. **Action Naming Inconsistencies**: Actions may be private, archived, or incorrectly named
3. **Version Management**: Actions may exist but not at specified versions
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Marketplace search may not reflect actual availability

## Solution Strategy
1. **Verify Before Use**: Always check action existence before implementation
2. **Prefer Standard Tools**: Use Node.js, Python, or shell scripts over external actions
3. **Local Dependencies**: Install packages like `jsonwebtoken` within workflows
4. **Fallback Plans**: Have manual implementation ready as backup

## Key Learnings
- External GitHub Actions introduce dependency risks
- Standard tooling (Node.js + npm packages) is more reliable
- Always validate action existence in marketplace before committing
- Custom scripts provide better control and reliability
