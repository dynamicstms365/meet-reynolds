## 🎯 Objective
Implement central orchestration and cross-platform decision-making capabilities for the Bridge Agent (Conductor) in our binary tree architecture.

## 📋 Description
Build the Bridge Agent that serves as the central conductor, orchestrating the specialized GitHub Enterprise and Microsoft 365 branches. This agent handles cross-platform intelligence, decision routing, and system-wide coordination.

## 🔧 Actions Required
- [ ] Implement cross-platform request routing logic
- [ ] Create intelligent decision-making algorithms for agent coordination  
- [ ] Add context preservation across GitHub and Microsoft 365 platforms
- [ ] Build agent health monitoring and failover mechanisms
- [ ] Implement adaptive learning for optimization patterns
- [ ] Create unified communication protocols between specialized agents
- [ ] Add performance metrics tracking and analysis

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Routes requests to appropriate specialized agents with >95% accuracy
- [ ] Maintains context across platform boundaries seamlessly
- [ ] Implements failover mechanisms with <5 second recovery time
- [ ] Tracks and optimizes agent performance continuously
- [ ] Provides unified interface for cross-platform operations
- [ ] Demonstrates learning from usage patterns over time

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Requires: Basic Copilot Agent Framework (Issue #9)
- Blocks: All specialized agent implementations

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Request routing accuracy: >95%
- Context preservation rate: >98%
- System recovery time: <5 seconds
- Cross-platform operation success: >90%
