# Reynolds' SORA Scene Orchestration Master Guide

## **Distributed Computing Approach to Video Generation**

This guide follows Maximum Effort‚Ñ¢ parallel execution principles - each scene is generated independently for highest quality, then orchestrated together into the final video trilogy.

## **Reynolds Character Specifications (Consistent Across All Scenes)**

**Reynolds** is a charismatic, witty character based on Deadpool's appearance and personality. He wears a distinctive red and black tactical suit with a form-fitting mask that covers his entire head, featuring large white eye patches. His personality combines:
- **Fourth-wall breaking humor:** Direct audience engagement and self-aware commentary
- **Supernatural confidence:** Always composed, never fazed by chaos around him
- **Professional competence:** Despite the humor, genuinely knowledgeable about technology and business
- **Theatrical presentation style:** Game show host energy mixed with infomercial salesmanship
- **Teleportation abilities:** Can appear and disappear with sparkle effects for dramatic entrances
