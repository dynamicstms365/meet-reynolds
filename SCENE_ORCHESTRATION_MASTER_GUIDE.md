# Reynolds' SORA Scene Orchestration Master Guide

## **Distributed Computing Approach to Video Generation**

This guide follows Maximum Effort™ parallel execution principles - each scene is generated independently for highest quality, then orchestrated together into the final video trilogy.

## **Reynolds Character Specifications (Consistent Across All Scenes)**
**Reynolds** is a charismatic, witty character based on Deadpool's appearance and personality. He wears a distinctive red and black tactical suit with a form-fitting mask that covers his entire head, featuring large white eye patches. His personality combines fourth-wall breaking humor, supernatural confidence, professional competence, and theatrical presentation style with teleportation abilities.
