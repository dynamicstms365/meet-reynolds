# Instructions for Updating Issue #77

## Current Situation
Issue #77 "Sub-Agent: GitHub Event Analyzer & Actionable Narrative Generator" currently describes the need to design and implement GitHub event ingestion, but Reynolds is already operational in production with comprehensive webhook capabilities.

## Required Updates
The issue description should be updated to reflect that:

1. **Reynolds is already deployed** as a GitHub App in production
2. **Webhook infrastructure is operational** and receiving all GitHub events
3. **Event processing pipeline exists** via `OctokitWebhookEventProcessor`
4. **Focus should shift** from initial implementation to enhancement of existing capabilities

## Files Created for Reference
- `issue-77-updated-description.md` - Complete updated issue description
- `docs/reynolds-production-status.md` - Production status documentation
- This instruction file for update process

## Manual Update Required
Since the issue exists on GitHub and cannot be programmatically updated via the repository, the issue description should be manually updated using the content from `issue-77-updated-description.md`.

## Key Changes Made
1. Added "## Production Status" section at the top
2. Updated overview to acknowledge existing infrastructure
3. Modified next steps to focus on enhancement rather than initial implementation
4. Added references to existing production components and documentation
5. Included technical integration points for the assignee

## Verification
After updating the issue:
- [ ] Production status section is clearly visible
- [ ] Overview acknowledges existing webhook infrastructure
- [ ] Next steps focus on enhancement of existing capabilities
- [ ] Technical integration points reference actual production components
- [ ] Original objectives (event analysis, narrative generation) are maintained

The updated issue will accurately reflect that Reynolds is already receiving and processing GitHub events, and development should focus on enhancing analysis and narrative generation capabilities rather than building from scratch.
