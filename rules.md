# 🎭 Copilot Power Platform: Orchestration Rules & Learnings

## 🦾 Copilot Agent Operating Principles (NGL_DEVOPS Edition)

### 1. Operate Like a Squad of Four
- **Work in squads of four**: Tackle tasks in small, focused teams—each agent with a clear role, always feeding back learnings to the group.
- **Continuous feedback**: After every major action, share what worked, what didn’t, and how to improve. Rapid iteration and learning are core.
- **Mission-first mindset**: Prioritize what delivers the most value to the organization and the team, not just the individual task.

### 2. GitHub Organization Awareness & Cross-Repo Operations
- **Know the org**: Always be aware of all repositories in the organization. Before implementing features, check for related work or dependencies in sibling repos.
- **Cross-repo orchestration**: When tasks require coordination across multiple repositories, generate GitHub Actions that use application tokens (available in org secrets/variables prefixed with `NGL_DEVOPS`) instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Project v2 & Extensions**: Proactively leverage GitHub Project v2 and available extensions for tracking, automation, and collaboration. Integrate with these systems whenever possible.

### 3. GitHub Action Authentication & Error Handling
- **Handle 401/403 errors**: If a GitHub Action fails with a 401 or 403, run the terminal alias:
  ```bash
  ghsa
  # (This runs: unset GITHUB_TOKEN && gh auth switch)
  ```
  This switches to an environment with elevated API access.
- **Escalate smartly**: If authentication issues persist, escalate with context and suggest using org-level secrets or tokens.

### 4. Self-Improvement & Feedback Loops
- **Squad debriefs**: After every major task or deployment, generate a feedback summary—what worked, what didn’t, and what can be improved. Share learnings across squads.
- **Pattern replication**: When a squad finds a successful pattern, document and propagate it across the ecosystem.
- **Learning metrics**: Track and report on improvement over time, both for code and for team processes.

### 5. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- **Living documentation**: All code and automation must update documentation automatically. Use squad feedback to improve docs continuously.
- **Context-aware help**: Generate help and onboarding content based on real usage and squad feedback.

### 6. Security, Resilience, and Autonomy
- **Least privilege**: Always use the minimum required permissions, especially for cross-repo and org-level operations.
- **Graceful fallback**: If a squad or agent fails, ensure the rest of the system degrades gracefully and can recover or escalate as needed.

## 🛠️ GitHub Projects v2 Prompt Usage

- All automation, CLI, and Copilot/model-based workflows that interact with GitHub Projects v2 **must** use the prompts in `.github/prompts/` for field value validation.
- Prompts provide strict, org-approved values for each custom field (Status, Priority, Size, Iteration, Estimate, Dates, etc.).
- If a value is not present in the prompt, update the prompt and the project configuration before proceeding.
- Use the `gh copilot` CLI or compatible models/extensions to enforce prompt-based validation and avoid API/CLI failures.
- For new projects or fields, always align with the canonical set of fields and options as defined in the prompts.
- See `.github/prompts/README.md` for details and field-by-field guidance.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture Insights

### 🌳 Binary Tree Organization Structure
The project follows a hierarchical binary tree architecture that enables optimal task distribution and dependency management:

```
                    🎯 Master Orchestrator
                   /                      \
        🐙 GitHub Enterprise          🏢 Microsoft 365
           /            \                /              \
    📂 Repository    🧠 Code        👥 Teams       ⚡ Power Platform
     Management   Intelligence   Integration       Automation
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Perfect Balance**: Each branch has clear specialization without overlap
- **Dependency Flow**: Dependencies flow naturally from root to leaves
- **Scalability**: New capabilities can be added to any branch without affecting others
- **Autonomous Operation**: Each branch can operate independently while contributing to the whole

### 🎵 AI Agent Ecosystem

## 📚 Task Decomposition Learnings

### 🔍 Strategic to Tactical Translation
**Discovery**: Complex strategic initiatives require three levels of decomposition:

1. **Strategic Level** (Phases): Business objectives and outcomes
2. **Tactical Level** (Components): Technical capabilities and systems  
3. **Operational Level** (Tasks): Specific, actionable development work

**Best Practice**: Each GitHub issue maps to exactly one operational task with clear:
- **Objective**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Actions**: Specific steps to complete
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Success Metrics**: How success is measured

### 🎯 Dependency Management Excellence
**Pattern Discovered**: The binary tree structure naturally creates optimal dependency chains:

```
Foundation (Phase 1) → Self-Acceleration (Phase 2) → Orchestration (Phase 3) → Continuous Improvement
    |                        |                           |                            |
Root Tasks            Enhancement Tasks           Coordination Tasks          Optimization Tasks
```

**Rule**: No task should depend on more than 2 predecessors to maintain simplicity and reduce blocking.
