# Organizational Interaction Profiles

This directory contains auto-generated, living markdown profiles for each GitHub organization member. Profiles are generated by the script in `scripts/setup/generate-org-profiles.sh` and include:

- User bio and metadata
- Recent GitHub activity types (commit, PR, review, etc.)
- Last update timestamp

## How to Update Profiles

1. Ensure you have [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup/generate-org-profiles.sh <github-org>
   ```
3. Profiles will be (re)generated in this directory as `<username>.md` files.

## Extensibility
- Designed for future integration with Microsoft Teams and additional activity analysis.
- Profiles are self-updating and support knowledge accumulation.

# Advanced Analytics & Dashboarding

The org profile system now supports advanced analytics and dashboarding:

- **Dashboard:** `docs/org-profiles/dashboard.md` auto-generates:
  - Member overview table
  - Mermaid diagram of collaboration network
  - Activity metrics (most active, top reviewers, expertise heatmap)
- **Script Extension:** Next, the script will be enhanced to populate these sections using GitHub data.

## Teams Integration Roadmap
- Map GitHub users to Teams users (via email or username)
- Extract Teams communication patterns (via Microsoft Graph API)
- Cross-reference and visualize collaboration across platforms
- Future: Suggest optimal communication and collaboration patterns
