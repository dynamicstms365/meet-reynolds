# Codespace Onboarding Agent Feature

## Overview

The Reynolds Copilot agent now includes **Codespace Creation and Onboarding** functionality that automatically sets up tailored development environments and provides interactive step-by-step guidance for new users.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Automated Codespace Setup
- **Automatic Environment Configuration**: Creates Codespaces with pre-configured tools and dependencies
- **Repository-Specific Settings**: Tailored configuration for Power Platform development
- **Pre-installed Tools**: 
  - Power Platform CLI (`pac`)
  - Microsoft 365 CLI (`m365`)
  - .NET 8 SDK
  - Recommended VS Code extensions

### ðŸ‘¥ Interactive Onboarding Experience
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Progressive onboarding through development setup
- **Interactive Cards**: Terminal-based guidance with helpful commands
- **Context-Aware Help**: Personalized assistance based on user progress
- **Welcome Messages**: Friendly introductions to the development environment

## Getting Started

### Creating a Codespace

Ask the Reynolds Copilot agent to create a Codespace:

```
"Create a new Codespace for this repository"
"Set up a development environment for me"
"I need a Codespace with Power Platform tools"
```

### Starting Onboarding

Begin the interactive onboarding experience:

```
"Help me get started"
"Start onboarding"
"reynolds onboard"
```

### Quick Commands

Once in your Codespace, use the `reynolds` helper command:

```bash
# Show welcome and onboarding information
reynolds onboard

# Build the project
reynolds build

# Run tests
reynolds test

# Start the development server
reynolds run

# Check installed tool versions
reynolds tools
```

## Onboarding Steps

The interactive onboarding includes:

1. **Welcome** - Introduction to the Power Platform development environment
2. **Tool Setup** - Installation of required CLI tools and dependencies
3. **Validation** - Verification of tool installations
4. **Codebase Exploration** - Guided tour of the project structure
5. **Build & Test** - Running initial build and test processes
6. **Environment Configuration** - Setting up development configurations
7. **Ready for Development** - Final setup completion and next steps

## Agent Integration

### Intent Recognition

The agent recognizes Codespace-related requests through patterns like:
- "create codespace", "setup workspace"
- "onboard", "welcome", "getting started"
- "development environment"
- "help me get started"

### Supported Operations

- **Codespace Creation**: `IntentType.CodespaceManagement`
- **Onboarding Management**: Progress tracking and step guidance
- **Environment Status**: Listing and monitoring Codespaces
- **Interactive Help**: Context-aware assistance

## Implementation Details

### New Services

#### CodespaceManagementService
- `CreateCodespaceAsync()` - Creates new Codespaces with specifications
- `GetCodespaceStatusAsync()` - Retrieves Codespace status and information
- `ListCodespacesAsync()` - Lists available Codespaces for repositories
- `DeleteCodespaceAsync()` - Manages Codespace lifecycle

#### OnboardingService
- `GetOnboardingStepsAsync()` - Returns structured onboarding steps
- `StartOnboardingAsync()` - Initializes user onboarding session
- `UpdateProgressAsync()` - Tracks and advances onboarding progress
- `GenerateWelcomeMessageAsync()` - Creates personalized welcome messages

### Configuration Files

#### `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- Pre-configured development container
- Required tools and extensions
- Port forwarding and environment settings

#### Setup Scripts
- `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` - Initial environment setup
- `.devcontainer/post-start.sh` - Startup welcome and validation

### Models

New data models for Codespace management:
- `CodespaceSpec` - Codespace creation specifications
- `CodespaceResult` - Operation results and metadata
- `OnboardingStep` - Individual onboarding step definitions
- `OnboardingProgress` - User progress tracking

## Integration with Existing Features

### PowerPlatformAgent Enhancement
- Extended with `HandleCodespaceRequest()` method
- Automatic onboarding trigger for new Codespaces
- Enhanced help messages including Codespace features

### Intent Recognition Updates
- Added `IntentType.CodespaceManagement` patterns
- Recognition of onboarding and setup terminology
- Context-aware intent classification

## Usage Examples

### Basic Codespace Creation
```csharp
var spec = new CodespaceSpec
{
    RepositoryName = "copilot-powerplatform",
    Branch = "main",
    AutomaticOnboarding = true
};

var result = await codespaceService.CreateCodespaceAsync(spec);
```

### Onboarding Progress Tracking
```csharp
var progress = await onboardingService.StartOnboardingAsync(userId, codespaceId);
var steps = await onboardingService.GetOnboardingStepsAsync();

// Progress through steps
await onboardingService.UpdateProgressAsync(userId, "welcome", stepData);
```

## Benefits

### For New Users
- **Faster Onboarding**: Automated environment setup reduces setup time
- **Guided Learning**: Step-by-step progression through development concepts
- **Reduced Friction**: Pre-configured tools eliminate common setup issues
- **Interactive Support**: Real-time help and guidance

### For Development Teams
- **Consistent Environments**: Standardized development setups
- **Reduced Support Overhead**: Self-guided onboarding reduces support requests
- **Better Developer Experience**: Smooth introduction to development workflows
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Embedded best practices and documentation

## Future Enhancements

- **GitHub API Integration**: Real Codespace creation via GitHub APIs
- **Advanced Analytics**: Onboarding completion tracking and optimization
- **Personalized Paths**: Custom onboarding flows based on user roles
- **Team Templates**: Organization-specific onboarding customizations
