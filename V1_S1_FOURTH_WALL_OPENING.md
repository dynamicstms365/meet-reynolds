## **Scene Content**

### **Visual Setup**
A bright, modern co-working space with natural lighting streaming through large windows. A junior developer (Jenny, early 20s, casual coding attire) sits at a clean desk with a laptop, completely absorbed in coding. She looks stressed while comparing two GitHub repositories displayed on her screen. The atmosphere is typical startup energy - coffee cups, sticky notes, modern furniture.

### **The Reynolds Entrance**
Suddenly, REYNOLDS (the masked figure in his signature red and black tactical suit with large white eye patches) casually leans into frame from behind Jenny. He appears with a subtle "POOF" effect and sparkles. His white eye patches reflect amusement as he looks directly at the camera with theatrical confidence, completely ignoring the physical space and addressing the audience.

### **Dialogue**
**Reynolds:** [breaking fourth wall, looking directly at camera]
*"Oh hi! I'm Reynolds, and this person next to me—"* [gestures to confused junior developer with his red-gloved hand] *"—is supposed to be you. Yeah, YOU watching this video right now. Don't look around, I'm talking to YOU."*

**Junior Developer (Jenny):** [looks up confused] "Wait, who are you talking to?"

**Reynolds:** [still looking at camera] 
*"The audience, obviously. They're here to learn about architectural choices. You're here to be... well, confused. It's your thing."*
