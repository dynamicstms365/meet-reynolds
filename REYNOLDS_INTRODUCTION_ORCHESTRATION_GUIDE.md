# 🎭 Reynolds Introduction Orchestration System
*Maximum Effort™ Cross-Platform User Introduction Framework*

## Overview

This system enables Reynolds, our supernatural coordination agent, to receive Teams messages like "Introduce yourself to Ari" and orchestrate intelligent cross-platform user discovery, mapping, and introduction execution.

## Architecture Components

### 🔧 Teams Agent (TypeScript)
- **Location**: `reynolds-teams-project/Reynolds Teams Agent/`
- **Purpose**: Intent recognition and frontend coordination
- **Key Features**:
  - Natural language processing for introduction requests
  - Backend API coordination
  - Real-time user feedback

### 🎯 Backend Services (C#)
- **IntroductionOrchestrationService**: Master workflow coordinator
- **MicrosoftGraphUserService**: Enterprise user discovery
- **GitHubOrganizationService**: GitHub member enumeration
- **UserMappingService**: Cross-platform identity caching
- **ReynoldsTeamsChatService**: Teams message execution

### 🌐 API Endpoints
- `POST /api/introductions/orchestrate` - Main orchestration endpoint
- `POST /api/introductions/confirm-mapping` - User mapping confirmation
- `GET /api/introductions/github-members` - GitHub member list
- `GET /api/introductions/test-connectivity` - Health check

## Workflow

### 1. Intent Recognition
```
User: "Introduce yourself to Ari"
↓
Teams Agent recognizes introduction pattern
↓
Calls backend orchestration API
```

### 2. User Discovery Cascade
```
Check cache for "Ari" mapping
↓ (if not found)
Search Microsoft Graph for "Ari"
↓ (if found but no GitHub mapping)
Request GitHub organization members
↓
Present mapping options to user
```

### 3. Introduction Execution
```
User confirms: "Ari Johnson → NextGenerationLogistics"
↓
Store validated mapping
↓
Send Reynolds introduction message to Ari
↓
Confirm success to requesting user
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Introduction
```
User: "Introduce yourself to NewPerson"
↓
Reynolds: "🎯 Maximum Effort™ activated! Looking up NewPerson..."
↓
Reynolds: "Hey! I found NewPerson (newperson@company.com) in Microsoft Graph, 
          but need help mapping to GitHub. Here are our GitHub members..."
↓
User: Confirms mapping
↓
Reynolds: "✅ Maximum Effort™ successful! Introduced myself to NewPerson!"
```

### Scenario 2: Validated User (Test Case)
```
User: "Introduce yourself to Ari"
↓ (cache hit: Ari Johnson → NextGenerationLogistics)
Reynolds: "✅ Maximum Effort™ successful! Introduced myself to Ari Johnson!"
```

### Scenario 3: Test Validation
```
Input: christaylor@nextgeneration.com requesting introduction to "Ari"
Expected: Maps to NextGenerationLogistics GitHub user
Result: Reynolds sends introduction message with coordination charm
```
